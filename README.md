It is a similar app of discord bot. It's a multiuser app with multiple rooms. A user can join and select his/her room and start chatting. 

## The features-
Multiuser chatting app
Welcome message whenever you enter
Notification whenever someone joined the room
Any time can leave room

##Folder - utils
The utils folder contain the javascript files of message and users.

I built this using mainly node.js, express.js, socket.io, HTML, CSS and javascript. Upload the files in got repository and deployed it on Heroku to host in live server.

## Inspiration
The inspiration to make this chat app was come into my mind a long time ago. We all know that from the very beginning of this over the year and non-terminating pandemic situation have made us quarantine. For this the only way to connect with our friends and family left was to connect virtually. So, social media and other online platforms had become the most necessary part of our lives. In this context chatting platform has become mandatory for us. So, I've got the inspiration to make a multiusers chatting app with different rooms or channels they like.
